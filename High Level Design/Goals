Goals / Non-functional requirements

Scalability: handle bursts from MB/s → GB/s sustained; store TB→PB.

High availability: 99.99%+ for ingestion and metadata; eventual consistency acceptable for large analytic stores.

Fault tolerance: message durability, checkpointing, automated recovery.

Low-latency fetch for scientist dashboards; bulk downloads for analysis.

Security: encryption at rest/in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), audit logging.

Cost-awareness: tiered storage (hot/warm/cold).
