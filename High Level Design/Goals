# Goals / Non-functional requirements

1. Scalability: handle bursts from MB/s → GB/s sustained; store TB→PB.

2. High availability: 99.99%+ for ingestion and metadata; eventual consistency acceptable for large analytic stores.

3. Fault tolerance: message durability, checkpointing, automated recovery.

4. Low-latency fetch for scientist dashboards; bulk downloads for analysis.

5. Security: encryption at rest/in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), audit logging.

6. Cost-awareness: tiered storage (hot/warm/cold).
