1. Ingest node fails mid-upload
Upload is multi-part → other node retries using same multi-part; metadata marks partial → finalize or abort.

2. Kafka broker outage
Configure replication factor >2 and min.insync.replicas; producers buffer and retry; have a DLQ for messages that fail continually.

3. Consumer fails after writing derived file but before committing offset
Use idempotent writes + metadata update + transactional commits if possible. On restart check derivedPath existence and metadata to avoid reprocessing.

4. Object store region outage
Cross-region replication or backup bucket; failover readers to replica; alert SRE to restore.

5. Metadata DB outage
Read replicas + warm standby; store minimal essential info in Kafka for recovery; degrade to read-only for non-critical functions.
