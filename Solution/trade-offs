1. Message Bus vs Direct Write
Use message bus when you need decoupling, spikes tolerance, multi-subscriber processing. Direct writes are simpler but tightly couple producer/consumer.

2. Object Store vs Block Storage
Object storage scales for PB. Block/NAS is faster for low-latency small IO but doesnâ€™t scale cost-effectively.

3. Streaming vs Batch
Streaming for near-real-time detection/alerting; batch for heavy reprocessing and complex analytics. Combine both (Lambda or Kappa architectures).

4. Exactly-once vs At-least-once
Exactly-once is costly; often at-least-once with idempotent processing is sufficient for satellite pipelines where you can detect duplicates via checksums and metadata.

5. SQL vs NoSQL for Metadata
Use SQL when you need strong consistency and complex queries (joins). NoSQL when you require write scalability. A hybrid (Postgres for metadata & Elastic for search) works well.

6.Geo-replication
Synchronous replication across regions is expensive and may increase latency. For critical mission data, async cross-region with automatic rehydration and validation is common.
